# keller2018-chr2-hotspot-chtc

files for use on CHTC Condor to analyze Keller 2018 chromosome 2 hotspot

## RDS file creation

We created RDS files to hold the trait measurements for each mouse. We documented creation of these files in a Rmd file, "keller-2018-rna-analysis/Rmd/2018-09-10_condor-setup.Rmd". This file is in the github repository "fboehm/keller-2018-rna-analysis".

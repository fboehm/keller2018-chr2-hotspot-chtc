```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goals

I want to identify the process ids for the jobs that didn't return a text file with scan_pvl results from run 2002.

I have transferred to my macbook the text files that chtc returned. They are in the directory "results/pvl-run2002".

```{r}
library(qtl2chtc)
```

```{r}
find_missing_jobs(DIR = "../results/pvl-run2002", njobs = 2780, outfile = "../results/bad-jobs-pvl-run2002")
```
